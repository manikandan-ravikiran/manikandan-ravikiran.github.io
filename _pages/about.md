## üßë About Me

I am Lead Research Scientist at ThoughtWorks Global AI Research, where I focus on enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) adoption through evaluation frameworks targeting **completeness**, **explanation fairness**, and **decoding optimization**. 

Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Hitachi R&D India, where I worked on **AI for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**, with emphasis on reasoning systems, project delivery, and scalable AI pipelines. My expertise spans **large-scale data analysis**, **project management**, and the development of mathematically grounded AI tools.

I enjoy generating novel ideas and devising scalable solutions to complex real-world problems. Parallel to my industry work, I am a **Ph.D. Scholar at IIT Mandi**, advised by **Prof. Rohit Saluja** and **Prof. Arnav Bhavsar** where I study rare and impactful problems in AI with applications to the **Education domain**.
