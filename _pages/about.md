Welcome! I am a Senior Research Engineer at <b> Hitachi Research & Development, AI Research Group, Bangalore </b> working on application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with multiple publications and patents. In parallel, I am also an Masters Student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, College of Computing Specializing on Interactive Intelligence. Previously, I completed my bachelors at PESIT-BSC, Bangalore where I worked under guidence of  Dr. Snehanshu Saha (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snehanshusaha/" style="text-decoration: none;"> APP CAIR BITS PILANI</a>) and Dr. Srikantamurthy.

Some of my collaborators include Dr. Vinay Namboodiri (<a href="http://deltalab.iitk.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">DelTA Lab, IIT-K </a>), Dr. Gaurav Sharma (<a href="http://grvsharma.com" style="text-decoration: none;"> IIT-K and INRIA-THOTH, NEC Media Anlytics - USA</a>),  Dr. Shinichi Satoh and Group (<a href="http://www.satoh-lab.nii.ac.jp/" style="text-decoration: none;"> National Institue of Informatics, Japan </a>), Dr. Andreas Dengel, Sheraz Ahmed, Jorn Hees (<a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments-and-groups/smart-data-knowledge-services/team-sds/" style="text-decoration: none;">   DFKI Germany - Smart Data & Knowledge Services Group</a>), Dr. Bharathi Raja Asoka Chakravarthi (<a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie:83/our-research/people/engineering-and-informatics/basokachakravarthi1/" style="text-decoration: none;"> National University of Ireland Galway </a>), Dr. Anand Kumar (<a href="https://infotech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/anand-kumar-m" style="text-decoration: none;"> National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal </a>)

My research interests are broadly in large scale applications of artificial intelligence including Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Recently, I am poking a bit around Low resource languages, Healthcare and Edtech. If interested to collaborate, feel free to email me.
