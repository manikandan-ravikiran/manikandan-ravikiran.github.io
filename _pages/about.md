Iâ€™m a Senior Research Engineer working at <b> Hitachi Research & Development, AI Research Group, Bangalore </b> to better understand how to improve software products across multiple areas including ADAS, Healthcare and Safety using Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. My expertise includes project management, large scale data analysis, with development and implementation of mathematical algorithms and tools. I enjoy generating novel ideas and devising scalable solutions to complex problems.

My colleagues would describe me as a driven, resourceful individual who maintains a proactive attitude when faced with adversity. In my free time, I dabble with research on low-resource AI, specifically focusing on social media, healthcare and educational products.
